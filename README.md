# Orchestrated AI Team — Technical Articles

Public home for technical write‑ups on orchestrated, multi‑agent AI systems.

## Contents
- `TECH_DRAFT.md` — Technical walkthrough of a Clawdbot‑style orchestration stack (gateway, agents, sandboxing, webhooks, heartbeats, delegation, model selection, and workflow discipline).
- Public article: https://adams-ai-journey.ghost.io/2026-the-year-of-the-orchestrator/

## Why this repo
I’m publishing these as standalone articles so they can evolve independently of internal notes. Future posts and revisions will live here.

## Contributing
PRs welcome if you have concrete improvements, corrections, or diagrams to add.
